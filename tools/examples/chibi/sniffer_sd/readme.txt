Uses 'PROMISCUOUS' mode in Chibi, which listens to ANY message available within
hearing range, and logs the messages to the SD card in libpcap format (which can be
opened directly in Wireshark).  This useful functionality is perfect for debugging
wireless sensor networks since you can capture, log and later analyse all traffic
and frame data moving around the wireless sensor network.
